# GIFReverse
## A fully client side gif reverser

Every gif reverser on the internet sucks, and I've been playing around with gif editing in the browser, so this seemed like a fun thing to do.

Uses:

* jsgif for decoding: https://github.com/shachaf/jsgif
* gif.js for encoding: https://github.com/jnordberg/gif.js

Requires web workers, and html5 file API support. Should work in Latest FF, Safari, Chrome and IE10+.
